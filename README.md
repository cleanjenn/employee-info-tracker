# Description

I used a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team. Then the application generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person in place card.  The HTML file is then displayed in a separate file directory that is located [Here](./dist/index.html)

The full video showing functionallity of the appliction including the tests that were ran to collect the employees data can be accessed via this link:
